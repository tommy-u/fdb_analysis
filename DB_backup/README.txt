FDB_v2014.xls is the Forensic Data Base filled with positively identified specimines. 
Cranial.csv is a copy of the cranial measurements in dos CSV format (CR returns).

dosCSV2Mac converts these CSVs to unix friendly format (\r -> \n)

The FDB and dos CSV exports are write protected so they are not compromised.
